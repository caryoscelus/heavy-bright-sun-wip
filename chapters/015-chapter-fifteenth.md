Chapter Fifteen
---------------

When i woke up, i found myself still in the same cabin, but the curtains were
already closed and the light was turned on. Somewhere in the distance, Sasha and
Ivan were discussing something in low voices. I stretched my body and got up.

— And why are you waking up at such time of day, Izzy? — i mumbled to myself.

I had no chance to answer though.

— Hey, Bella? Did you get up? — asked Sasha, noticing i'm awake.

Suddenly, a hazy memory came back to me, but only for a brief moment.

— Oh yeah, it seems that i made this mistake, — i answered, yawning.

— Well, we wouldn't mind if you'd stay there for an hour or two more.

— Maybe you wouldn't, but i've got things to do.

— Ah yeah, your business. Maybe it's finally time to talk about it?

— Maybe, maybe. Perhaps we should start with the local news though.

— News, huh? Does it have anything to do with Blue?

— Oh yeah. I'm wondering if it already hit the news.

— Okay, let me see...

Sasha turned to a laptop sitting on her knees and started typing. Tap-tap...
Tap-tap.. Sounds of keyboard reminded me of something, but then Sasha
interrupted.

— Hmm, xxxxx.. was found strangled to death in a hotel number, that's it?

For some reason these words that were but a translation of some news article
finally made me realize that my vengeance was really over. I took a deep breath
and calmed myself.

— They sure are fast. I'd think they wouldn't announce it today.

— Well, they haven't, yet. I'm just reading insider news channel. I'm a
journalist, in the end.

— Ah yeah.. Information leaks, — i paused, — So, now you know. I contracted Blue
to kill that guy. But before i continue, lets drink some tea.

Something drips... and drips... and keeps dripping. Shadows fall.

And then!..

— So then, — i sipped strong black tea and continued, — you must be wondering
who this Andrey Portnov is. Well, as you might have seen, he's currently senator
or something. But how do i happen to know a senator in these parts? Or maybe you
think i'm just a proxy contractor?

— You might be, for all i know. But i suppose you'd be more secretive in that
case.

— Yeah, i suppose so. I don't even know why am i so carefree lately, — that is
what i said, but i already had a more or less correct understanding of that. I
accomplished my goal and, on one hand, had no need to be careful anymore; on the
other, i wanted to celebrate, to relax — Anyway, i suppose you can look up the
guy's biography, — i continued, — He claims to be russian immigrant descendant.
And i suppose that might be true. Back in the day when i knew him, he called
himself Andrew Portnau.
