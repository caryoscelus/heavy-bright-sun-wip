Chapter Seventeen
-----------------

Sitting in a comfortable seat of an air charter flying across continent, i tried
to forget about the cold harsh reality of outside world that lay both in the
past and the future of that unexpected flight. Well, sometimes i think that, on
the contrary, it is those moments of relaxation and thinking that are reality
and the rest of my life is not much different from a film or a video game.

But how much of this is really worth considering and how much of it is just
playing with language? Useless question.

Back then, in that plane i didn't really think of these highly abstract concepts
that i sometimes like to ponder on now. Back then, after i've successively rid
my mind of present problems, it uncontrollably sunk into past.
