Chapter Seventeenth
-------------------

When i woke up, i found myself still in the same cabin, but the curtains were
already closed and the light was turned on. Somewhere in the distance, Sasha and
Ivan were discussing something in low voices. I stretched my body and got up.

— And why are you waking up at such a time of day, Izzy? — i mumbled to myself.

Me had no chance to answer though.

— Hey, Bella? Did you get up? — asked Sasha, noticing my awakening.

Suddenly, a hazy memory came back to me, but only for a brief moment.

— Oh yeah, it seems that i made this mistake, — i answered, yawning.

— Well, we wouldn't mind if you'd stay there for an hour or two more.

— Maybe you wouldn't, but i've got things to do.

— Ah yeah, your business. Maybe it's finally time to talk about it?

— Maybe, maybe. Perhaps we should start with the local media though.

— Media, huh? Does it have anything to do with Blue?

— Oh yeah. I'm wondering if it already hit the news.

— Okay, let me see...

Sasha turned to a laptop sitting comfortably on her lap and started
typing. Tap-tap... Tap-tap.. Sounds of keyboard reminded me of something, but
then Sasha interrupted.

— Hmm, Andrey Portnov.. was found strangled to death in a hotel number, that's
it?

For some reason these words that were but a translation of some apathetic,
written without even pretense of human sympathy, article finally made me realize
that my vengeance was really over. I took a deep breath and calmed myself.

— They sure are fast. I'd think they wouldn't announce it today.

— Well, they haven't, yet. I'm just reading insider news channel. I'm
*journalist*, in the end.

— Ah yeah.. Information leaks, — i paused, — So, now you know. I contracted Blue
to kill that guy. But before i continue i need another cup of caffeinated
beverage.

Something drips... and drips... and keeps dripping. Shadows fall.

And then!..

    ***

— So then, — i sipped strong black tea and continued, — you must be wondering
who this Andrey Portnov is. Well, as you might have seen, he was a senator or
something like that just recently. But how do i happen to know a senator in
these parts?  Or maybe you think i'm just a proxy contractor?

— You might be, for all i know. But i suppose you'd be more secretive in that
case.

— Yeah, i suppose so. I don't even know why am i so carefree lately, — that was
what i said, but deep in my mind i already had a more or less coherent
understanding of why was i so. I accomplished my goal and, on one hand, had no
need to be careful anymore; on the other, i wanted to celebrate, to relax. But
then on the third hand, there perhaps was still a hint of mystery in that.

— Anyway, i suppose you can look up the guy's biography, — i continued, — He
claims to be russian immigrant descendant. And i suppose that might be true.
But back in the day when i knew him, he called himself Andrew Portnau and wasn't
very eager to discuss his ancestors, to say the least.

I took a few more sips of tea, making a pause to hide my emotions towards my
freshly dead enemy.

— He always strove for power, but i noticed the terrible proportions of his
desire way too late. When he had come to our squadron, we all thought he was one
of those flying fans. He acted like one anyway. Had a big collection of assorted
copter and jet figurines, was boasting some prestigious pilot sims
awards. Typical otaku who had the guts to go irl, that's what we thought of him.

This was all i could easily say about my impressions of him. After a short
pause, i continued my slightly chaotic thoughts.

— It probably sounds banal, but we all had meals together, fought together...
Nobody would think he would be a traitor. But then can you call someone who was
never really on your side a traitor? He worked for Agency from the day zero, as
he later admitted.

Dark memories flooded my brain, almost making me want to vomit. But i've never
had the ability to actually physically vomit from psychological trauma; it
wasn't a good time to start anyway.

— I thought i'd be able to talk about him now, after all these years, — i said
with bitter irony, — but apparently those memories never fade. Let me be brief
then.

    ***

"I created this monster. I wanted it to be strong. I have no reasons to blame
anybody, but myself."

Having said that, the monster fighter started their last, unequal, hopeless
fight.

...After finishing my story, i leaned back; a bad feeling in my mouth reminded me
of an even earlier memory: my first cigarette in the school backyard. I laughed
at the thought that the shy girl trying to look cool and then afraid of coughing
out her lungs was also me. Or perhaps just imagined laughing, for i didn't
actually hear the sound.

It was only then that i noticed that Ivan has silently disappeared. It must have
been boring to listen to foreign speech indeed. Sasha seemed to be fascinated by
the story, though she said nothing and i couldn't be sure about her reaction
from her appearance.

Sounds of slow freight train that had been crawling around for a while suddenly
caught my attention. I wondered what will happen if i walk away and jump onto
one of its flatcars. "Perhaps i would be caught and prosecuted, or maybe nobody
cares about this stuff anymore?"

I contemplated those stray thoughts for a few long moments, then tried to stop
being melancholic; then, after a few more seconds of hesitation, got up.

— Well, should we go then? — i tried to sound as bright as possible, — Or,
perhaps, now that you know the story, it's a good moment to stop following me?

— Sorry, but you won't get rid of me that easily. Besides, i've just mailed my
clients that i won't be available for a while.

— Heh, it's not like i mind, — i wanted to add "as long as you help me out, i
don't care what your motives are", but then decided against it. Unfinished, the
end of my phrase stuck uncomfortably in the air.

Half a minute passed, measured by a few last wagons clapping on the rails. When
the sounds of train finally started to fade away, Sasha broke uneasy silence:

— We can go now, if you'd like, but do you have any idea of her whereabouts?

— She is quite a shady person, so it would be hard to be hundred percent sure,
but according to my research she likes to spend days at one of her winter
residences. "Sunny Valley", that was the name i think. The one that isn't far
from here. Without additional info i thought to start from there.

— "Sunny Valley", huh. Well, maybe i can get some more info.
