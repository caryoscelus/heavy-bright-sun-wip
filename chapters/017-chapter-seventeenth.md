Chapter Seventeenth

    ***

Does racing old cars on winter road in the middle of night counts as extreme
sport or as extravagant suicide method? Perhaps, a bit of both. It is also not
very safe for late bystanders and stray cars on steep turns. A small memorial
with cross and undead flowers — a very material, if not living, proof of these
dangers, — was highlighted by headlights of our speeding sedan for a few moments
before disappearing into eternal darkness.

— Here lies the last mayor of that wrecked town, — Sasha commented in a
surprisingly calm voice, — Or whatever left of his remains, anyway.

Barely managing to handle ancient controls of quickly moving vehicle, i barely
registered meaning of her words and had no time to reply. Few seconds later, our
car jumped up on a road bump, and the remnants of the lingering question "why"
in my head has disappeared altogether.

But Sasha continued nevertheless.

— He didn't *really* die in the car accident though. Well, his body did,
but.. they killed off about ninety-nine percents of his mind two hours before
that happened.

Sharp screeching of tires forced her to pause. I did a maneuver precise enough
to be proud of. But we had no time for such feelings. Our competitors, only a
few moments ago lost beyond a road turn, were quickly catching up.

— Funnily enough, those rats who did it are already dead. They all fought for
power, but in the end even the rat king fell by the hand of his bodyguards...

.........

— For all the blood they spilled and bled though, it was an interesting time to
be a journalist. Current dynamic equilibrium isn't as fun to watch. Maybe i
should just drop the whole politics theme and join the glorious lines of tech
adventurers?
