Chapter Seventeenth
-------------------

— My sit! My sit is taken! I demand a refund! — in the dark park alley, lit only
by sparse blinking street lights, a person in a hood screamed silently. Fifty
meters after, the complete refund was lying on the path, but it was still too
dark for anybody to see it.

Does racing old cars on winter road in the middle of night counts as extreme
sport or as extravagant suicide method? Perhaps, a bit of both. It is also not
very safe for late bystanders and stray cars on steep turns. A small memorial
with cross and undead flowers — a very material, if not living, proof of these
dangers, — was highlighted by headlights of our speeding sedan for a few moments
before disappearing into eternal darkness.

— Here lies the last mayor of that wrecked town, — Sasha commented in a
surprisingly calm voice, — Or whatever left of his remains, anyway.

Barely managing to handle ancient controls of quickly moving vehicle, i barely
registered meaning of her words and had no time to reply. Few seconds later, our
car jumped up on a road bump, and the remnants of the lingering question "why"
in my head has disappeared altogether.

But Sasha continued nevertheless.

— He didn't *really* die in the car accident though. Well, his body did,
but.. they killed off about ninety-nine percents of his mind two hours before
that happened.

Sharp screeching of tires forced her to pause. I did a maneuver precise enough
to be proud of. But we had no time for such feelings. Our competitors, only a
few moments ago lost beyond a road turn, were quickly catching up.

— Funnily enough, those rats who did it are already dead. They all fought for
power, but in the end even the rat king fell by the hand of his bodyguards...

I was getting a bit annoyed by Sasha's nonchalant attitude towards the dangers i
was fighting. I wondered whether she is used to such kind of situations or
simply have no fears. But yet again, i was much to busy driving to bring myself
to reply anything.

— For all the blood they spilled and bled though, it was an interesting time to
be a journalist. Current dynamic equilibrium isn't as fun to watch. Maybe i
should just drop the whole politics theme and join the glorious lines of tech
adventurers?

There seemed to be no end to this dark road filled with deathly turns and
bumps. I started getting tired of rotating mechanical wheel (??) and a bit
worried that we might not live through this night. On a relatively easy part of
the road, i finally brought myself to stop Sasha's rambling:

— So, how much more is left till the city? — i wanted to also complain about our
car lacking navigator, but then remembered it wasn't Sasha's one anyway.

— Lemme see. There's going to be an abandoned gas station after a couple turns
and then it's a straight line of five kilometers. But the Predators will not go
all the way; you need to hang on just a bit after that station.

— If you knew that much, why did we even go onto this dangerous path? — i could
no longer hide my irritation.

— Well, it's not like there were viable alternatives. I'm not a big fan of
roundabout ways. Besides, i trusted you could put this bad parody of racers to
shame.

— So you did plan it all along, — i sighted.

— I took all the risks into account, that's all.

Another sharp turn shook our car, forcing us to shut up for a while.

Endless stream of small details across unlimited canvas. Infinite attempts to
put them into limited order. Just as much tries to get uncaged experience out of
it.

All of this burned with approximately same amount of heat.

Despite i've been used to hi-tech control systems more similar to old-school
racing game controls than to this twentieth century anachronism, my driver
instincts still couldn't be matched by some third-grade dilettantes of violent
racing. But no matter how good you are, in this world there are physical
limitations unovercomeable by mere mortals.

What Sasha didn't account for was the risk of getting outright ???? taraned ????
by simply more powerful car with nitrogen boosters. Even if could secure us a
win in an honest race, there was nothing to do against this brute force. The
only chance to get away we had was to make Predators crash before that gasoline
station, when they were still playing competitive.

But in the end they only crashed into our car, sending already speeding sedan
forward and then, attacking it from the side, into the ??????.

I don't know whether this was pure luck or remains of my driving skills which
saved us in the end. Our car scratched over a birch tree, losing a slice of its
head along with the left door, and slowing down just enough to not kill us on
the next impact into an old oak.

Our predators pulled the brakes and rammed into another tree
