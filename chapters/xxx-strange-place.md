I found myself in a strange place. For a second or few i thought it looked like
a box, was a box. But it was only a matter of reaching out my hand before i
realized: what i took for the walls was nothing more than thickening of
space. My hand had only experienced a warm dark pressure, but it could still
move forward. "Ah, i'm free", i thought to myself, implying freedom of movement,
implying not being trapped in a small space. But when i've put my thought into
words, it sounded like more than just that. I. Am. Free?

I pushed myself — or at least something that played role of my body — forward,
and it started flying through the dark fluid matter, something that i thought
appropriate to call "cosmos". But then, as i noticed myself thinking about this
"cosmos", i couldn't help but wonder why do i call it "cosmos" rather than more
common "universe" or "space". "Cosmos isn't just space", i thought slowly,
repeating myself — it was hard to think — "Cosmos is the opposite of
Chaos". After a while of letting that thought sink in, i started to notice that
the "dark space" indeed had a complex structure.

Reaching my hand out of the stream i was flowing through, i grabbed and drew out
a handful of dark fractallic fluid. Thin lines were lightening up with red and
violet, pulsating, glowing back into darkness and taking new forms. I couldn't
even think about how magically beautiful it was at the time, but now i realize
it was the best sight i had ever seen. "Majestic" would be a good word to
describe it, but at that point i did not have words. Time worked differently
too.
