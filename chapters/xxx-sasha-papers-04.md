Sasha papers, pt IV
-------------------

So i've decided to cut the previous "chapter" on this cool cliffhanger, but
really the time gap in-between was only filled with one cup of tea.. Actually,
half of a cup.

Back in the train, the atmosphere of upcoming party was already unfolding. We've
just finished with acquainting and someone was already holding a stack of cards.

"Как старомодно" ("how old-schooled"), said rocker dude, but joined the game
nevertheless. That said, it wasn't as old-schooled as one could think: after a
brief discussion we decided to play a game supposedly invented in the same year
as the Earth was first properly flown over by a non-refilling aircraft (if you
can't parse that later part of this sentence, that's ok; i have troubles with it
on re-read also; but i won't make excuses for the random info dump).

...

Luckily we ended up on the same team with Isabella. I would've probably betrayed
my team otherwise. As is, we continued to play out our roles, until both of us
were prosecuted. She fell first and i even managed to avenge her, but had to pay
appropriate price for it.

But we didn't stop after the first game either. In the next one we were divided
by cruel fate; a game after — together again. I was inventing crazy stories
based on the game in my head, and perhaps that contributed to my team losing
every time. In the end, it didn't matter much.

At some point, we started to get bored and somebody proposed to play another
kind of party game. One even more recent, and designed specifically to force
people into learning about each other.
