Sasha papers, pt IV
-------------------

So i've decided to cut the previous "chapter" on this cool cliffhanger, but
really the time gap in-between was only filled with one cup of tea.. Actually,
half of a cup.

Back in the train, the atmosphere of upcoming party was already unfolding. We've
just finished with acquainting and someone was already holding a stack of cards.

"Как старомодно" ("how old-schooled"), said rocker dude, but joined the game
nevertheless. That said, it wasn't as old-schooled as one could think: after a
brief discussion we decided to play a game supposedly invented in the same year
as the Earth was first properly flown over by a non-refilling aircraft (if you
can't parse that later part of this sentence, that's ok; i have troubles with it
on re-read also).

...

Luckily we ended up on the same team with Isabella.
