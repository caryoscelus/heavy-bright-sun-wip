Sasha papers, pt III
--------------------

So here i am again, riding the train, but sorry, i'm not going to write much
this time. Why? Cause i'm not alone now. I'm actually in a noisy company and i
have to write this from my phone, pretending i'm sending an important message.

Writing will have to wait until i have some more time to myself, even though i'd
really to share my impression of my companions: it sure seems like my
long-awaited adventure might have finally started.

...

Just checked in to say that i'm still too busy to write anything. Yeah, i've
arrived at the party, ho-ho!

...

Hmm, it's really hard to get back to writing after so eventful times.

Where should i start? In the ever-present now or from the moment that i stopped
on?

...

Ok, lets start with now. I'm sitting on a chair inside an old freight train car,
which for many years now functions as a home for the station watchman.

Now, what am i doing here? And how did i get here?

On one hand, i could just mention that the watchman is my old acquaintance and
waive the rest of the questions off.

On the other, that's not my goal. I'm suppose to be writing a memoir or
something. So lets go into the past details.

...

I started this so called "chapter" in the train, so lets return there for a
moment. I said i wasn't alone and indeed i was in a company of four other
people, most of whom i just met that day.

...

Of all those people there was one who i found the most interesting (and also
attractive). Her name is Isabella, or Bella for short.
